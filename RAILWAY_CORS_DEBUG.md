# Railway CORS Debugging Guide

## Problem
Railway is overriding our CORS headers with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://railway.com` instead of allowing our frontend domain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom CORS Middleware
- Disabled FastAPI's built-in CORS middleware
- Implemented custom middleware that handles OPTIONS requests directly
- Added extensive logging to see what headers are being set

### 2. Multiple Header Variations
- Setting headers in multiple case variations (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, access-control-allow-origin, etc.)
- Using wildcard (*) to be maximally permissive
- Adding Railway-specific headers

### 3. Docker Configuration
- Created Dockerfile to use Docker instead of Nixpacks
- This might bypass Railway's automatic CORS handling

### 4. Test Endpoints
- Added `/api/cors-test` endpoint to debug CORS
- Added explicit OPTIONS handler

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Railway Logs
Look for these log messages:
```
RAILWAY CORS: Request from origin: https://campscout-demo.surge.sh
RAILWAY CORS: OPTIONS response headers: {...}
RAILWAY CORS: Final response headers: {...}
```

### 2. Test CORS Endpoint
Try calling: `https://campscout-backend-demo.railway.app/api/cors-test`

### 3. Check Browser Network Tab
- Look at the actual headers being returned
- Check if our custom headers are present

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Railway Environment Variables
Try setting these in Railway dashboard:
- `RAILWAY_CORS_ORIGIN=*`
- `DISABLE_RAILWAY_CORS=true`

### Option 2: Custom Domain
- Use a custom domain instead of Railway's subdomain
- This might bypass Railway's proxy

### Option 3: Different Deployment Method
- Try deploying without railway.json
- Use environment variables only

### Option 4: Proxy Configuration
If Railway is using a reverse proxy, we might need to:
- Set `X-Forwarded-*` headers
- Configure trust proxy settings

## Current Status
- Custom CORS middleware implemented
- Extensive logging added
- Docker configuration created
- Ready for testing on Railway
